# GitHub Training Task - Fibonacci Series (Multiple Languages)
       
Welcome to the GitHub training bootcamp! Your task is to fix a simple Fibonacci program. The repository contains four files in the *main branch*, each corresponding to a different programming language: Python, C, C++, and Java.

## üìå Task Description
Each file contains an incomplete Fibonacci program with missing parts marked as FIXME. Your job is to fix the code, commit your changes, and submit a pull request.

## üöÄ Steps to Complete the Task

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
First, clone the GitHub repository to your local system.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Branch
You must create a new branch before making changes. The branch name should be based on the language you are working with.(example given below):
sh
git checkout -b fix-bug-gitstudenthub-python  # For Python

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fix the Code
Open the respective file and resolve the FIXME comments by correcting the Fibonacci series implementation.

*Files to Fix:(Any ONE)*
- main.py (Python)
- main.c (C)
- main.cpp (C++)
- Main.java (Java)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Commit Your Changes
After fixing the code, stage and commit your changes.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Push Your Changes
Push your branch to GitHub.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Pull Request (PR)
- Go to the *GitHub repository* in your browser.
- Click on *Compare & pull request*.
- Add a brief message about your fix.
- Click *Create pull request*.

## ‚úÖ Completion Criteria
- Your PR should contain a correctly working Fibonacci program.
- The PR should follow the branch naming convention: fix-bug-gitstudenthub-[language].
- GitHub Actions will check if your code compiles and runs correctly.

## üî• Good Luck!
